                <h3>Latest Kpop</h3>
                <p> K-pop (Korean: 케이팝; RR: keipap), short for Korean popular music,[1] is a form of popular music originating in South Korea as part of South Korean culture.[2] It includes styles and genres from around the world, such as pop, hip hop, R&B, rock, jazz, gospel, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, disco, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots.[3] The term "K-pop" became popular in the 2000s, especially in the international context. The Korean term for domestic pop music is gayo (가요; 歌謠), which is still widely used within South Korea.[4][5] While "K-pop" can refer to all popular music or pop music from South Korea, it is colloquially often used in a narrower sense for any Korean music and artists associated with the entertainment and idol industry in the country, regardless of the genre.[contradictory]

                    The more modern form of the genre, originally termed "rap dance", emerged with the formation of the hip hop boy band Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene.[6]
                    
                    Modern K-pop "idol" culture began in the 1990s, as K-pop idol music grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults.[7][8] After a slump in early idol music, from 2003, TVXQ and BoA started a new generation of K-pop idols that broke the music genre into the neighboring Japanese market and continue to popularize K-pop internationally today.[9][10] With the advent of online social networking services and South Korean TV shows, the current spread of K-pop and South Korean entertainment, known as the Korean Wave, is seen not only in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but also in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Latin America, North Africa, Southern Africa and East Africa, the Middle East, and throughout the Western world, gaining an international audience.
                    
                    In 2018, K-pop experienced significant growth and became a "power player", marking a 17.9% increase in revenue growth. As of 2019, Korean popular music is ranked at number six among the top ten music markets worldwide according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's "Global Music Report 2019", with BTS and Blackpink cited as artists leading the market growth.[11] In 2020, K-pop experienced a record-breaking year when it experienced a 44.8% growth and positioned itself as the fastest-growing major market of the year.[12]

                <h3>latest j-pop trends</h3>
                <p> J-pop (Japanese: ジェイポップ, jeipoppu; often stylized in all caps; an abbreviated form of "Japanese popular music"), natively also known simply as pops (ポップス, poppusu), is the name for a form of popular music that entered the musical mainstream of Japan in the 1990s. Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional music of Japan, and significantly in 1960s pop and rock music. J-pop replaced kayōkyoku ("Lyric Singing Music", a term for Japanese popular music from the 1920s to the 1980s) in the Japanese music scene.[2]

                    Japanese rock bands such as Happy End fused the Beatles and Beach Boys-style rock with Japanese music in the 1960s–1970s.[3] Japanese country had popularity during the international popularity of Westerns in the 1960s–1970s as well, and it still has appeal due to the work of musicians like Charlie Nagatani, Tomi Fujiyama, along with venues like Little Texas in Tokyo.[4][5] Japanese hip hop became mainstream with producer Nujabes and his work on Samurai Champloo,[6] Japanese pop culture is often seen with anime in hip hop.[7] Other trends in Japanese music include J-Euro in the early 1990s, namely Namie Amuro,[8] as well, Latin music, CCM, and gospel music have scenes within J-pop.[9][10]
                    
                    J-pop is further defined by new wave and crossover fusion acts of the late 1970s such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Southern All Stars.[11] Popular styles of Japanese pop music include technopop during the 1970s–1980s, city pop in the 1980s, and Shibuya-kei in the 1990s. </p>

                <h3>Bollywood music</h3>
                <p>Hindi film music, commonly referred to as ‘Bollywood music,’ is one of the most popular forms of music in the world today.
                    The Indian film industry produces up to 2,000 movies each year—more than double that of Hollywood. Bollywood is the Hindi-language film industry in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India.
                    
                    Bollywood music is derived from song-and-dance routines in Hindi films. Due to their enduring popular appeal and cultural impact, Bollywood songs and dances are a characteristic motif of Hindi cinema.
                    
                    One of the reasons for the popularity of Bollywood songs has been the willingness of composers to adopt and be influenced by various musical forms including Western pop, jazz, rock, and classical music. These songs are generally composed in Hindi, though often the vocabulary and language usage deviate from that of standard Hindi and can include the use of Urdu, Persian, and English words, along with compositions in various Hindi dialects.</p>

                <h3>Indian music</h3>
                <p>Music has always been an important part of Indian life. The range of musical phenomenon in India extends from simple melodies to what is one of the most well- developed "systems" of classical music in the world. There are references to various string and wind instruments, as well as several kinds of drums and cymbals, in the Vedas. Some date the advent of the system of classical Indian music to Amir Khusro. Muslim rulers and noblemen freely extended their patronage to music. In the courts of the Mughal emperors, music is said to have flourished, and the Tansen was one of the jewels of Akbar's court. 

                    The great poet-saints who chose to communicate in the vernacular tongues brought forth a great upheaval in north India and the Bhakti or devotional movements they led gained many adherents. The lyrics of Surdas, Tulsidas, and most particularly Kabir and Mirabai continue to be immensely popular. By the sixteenth century, the division between North Indian (Hindustani) and South Indian (Carnatic) music was also being more sharply delineated. Classical music, both Hindustani and Carnatic, may be either instrumental or vocal.</p>

                <h3>Carnatic music</h3>
                <p>Carnatic music, known as Karnāṭaka saṃgīta or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam in the South Indian languages, is a system of music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. It is one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu texts and traditions, particularly the Samaveda.[1] The other subgenre being Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian or Islamic influences from Northern India. The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gāyaki (singing) style.

                    Although there are stylistic differences, the basic elements of śruti (the relative musical pitch), svara (the musical sound of a single note), rāga (the mode or melodic formulæ), and tala (the rhythmic cycles) form the foundation of improvisation and composition in both Carnatic and Hindustani music. Although improvisation plays an important role, Carnatic music is mainly sung through compositions, especially the kriti (or kirtanam) – a form developed between the 14th and 20th centuries by composers such as Purandara Dasa, and the Trinity of Carnatic music. Carnatic music is also usually taught and learned through compositions.[2][3] Telugu language predominates in the evolution of Carnatic music.[4][5] Most Carnatic compositions are in Telugu and Sanskrit along with some in Tamil and Kannada.[6]
                    
                    Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, consisting of a principal performer (usually a vocalist), a melodic accompaniment (usually a violin), a rhythm accompaniment (usually a mridangam), and a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the performance. Other typical instruments used in performances may include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, venu flute, veena, and chitraveena. The greatest concentration of Carnatic musicians is to be found in the city of Chennai.[7] Various Carnatic music festivals are held throughout India and abroad, including the Madras Mus</p>

                <h3>Hindustani music</h3>
                <p>Hindustani classical music is the classical music of the Indian subcontinent's northern regions. It may also be called North Indian classical music or, in Hindustani, shastriya sangeet. The term shastriya sangeet literally means classical music, and is also used to refer to Indian classical music in general.[1] It is played on instruments like the veena, sitar and sarod. Its origins from the 12th century CE, when it diverged from Carnatic music, the classical tradition in South India. While Carnatic music largely uses compositions written in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and sometimes in Sanskrit, Hindustani music largely uses compositions written in Urdu, Punjabi, Rajasthani and sometimes in Hindi.[2]

                    Knowledge of Hindustani classical music is taught through a culturally unique structure of classical music schools, called gharana. Hindustani classical music is an integral part of the culture of India and is performed across the country and internationally. Exponents of Hindustani classical music, including Ustad Bismillah Khan, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, and Ravi Shankar have been awarded with the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of India, for their contributions to the arts.[3]</p>
